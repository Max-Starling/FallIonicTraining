Now app has menu and 3 pages(home, list, settings). 
It's linked with github.com and ionicframework.com. 
Today this app can be launched in three ways:
- browser (by using command "npm run ionic:serve" it will be open on localhost:8200)
- mobile (by using Ionic View app with public code: "ccdcf8f7")
- mobile and emulator (by using apk files,that also working correctly with android version 6.3+), pc and browser (by using apk files and expansions/programs)
